## POSTS APP

Angular application that uses jsonplaceholder API to fetch 100 posts.

- By default, show the post id,
- When clicking on a square: replace the id with the userId
- When clicking again show the id 
- In the main branch donâ€™t use RxJS in to make shared state.
- Branch out and do exactly the same thing but with a shared state made by RxJS only

## Implementation

In master branch data fetching and error handling logic is implemented in container component while in [**shared_state_rxjs branch**](https://github.com/GoksenCodes/posts/tree/shared_state_rxjs) data is stored in a service and data manipulation logic related to the posts is moved to a sepetare service so that the components consumes the data through posts service. In shared_state_rxjs units tests are added for services.

## Libraries / Tools Used

- Angular 13

## Setup

To install dependencies run:

`npm install`

To run the app run:

`ng serve`

To execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) run:

`ng test`

## Future Work

1. Complete test coverage to achieve 90% in shared_state_rxjs.
2. Improve UX by displaying loader when data is loading
